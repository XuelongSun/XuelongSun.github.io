2022 is a very special year, not only to the world, but also to me.

In 2022, I have: 

1. Finally ended the Long-distant-4-years love with my girlfriend and we have our first warm home in Guangzhou.
2. I have started to be an independent researcher and got my first researching funding from the Youth Project of National Science Fundation of Chnia.
3. Learnt and tried the investment.
4. Leanrt and tries new sports like swiming (butterfly), skating and boxing. You know how sports attracts people ^V^.

I am looking forward to 2023! Keep moving and keep loving peoples that I am really care about.
