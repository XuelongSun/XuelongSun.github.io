### [A decentralised neural model explaining optimal integration of navigational strategies in insects](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54026)
We present a bio-constrained computational model that incorporates key elements for insects' visual navigation, including frequency-encoded image processing for visual homing and route following. Our model employs a ring attractor mechanism for optimal integration of navigational cues. Additionally, we investigate the roles of the central complex (CX) and mushroom bodies (MB) in insect navigation.

### [How the insect central complex could coordinate multimodal navigation](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73077)
Our findings suggest that the model proposed in my previous eLife paper can be applied to elucidate the olfactory navigation abilities of insects. This further supports the notion that the central complex (CX) serves as the navigation center in insects, highlighting the presence of shared mechanisms across sensory domains and even among different insect species.

### [An insect-inspired model facilitating autonomous navigation by incorporating goal approaching and collision avoidance](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2023.05.033)
We have developed a navigation model solely inspired by insects, enabling autonomous navigation in a three-dimensional (3D) environment encompassing both static and dynamic obstacles.

### [A Versatile Vision-Pheromone-Communication Platform for Swarm Robotics](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561911)
We are pleased to announce the successful implementation of a dynamic changeable wall in the arena, marking a significant advancement in our research. This addition introduces a dynamic element, enabling versatile and realistic experiments. The ability to modify the wall configuration opens new possibilities for studying diverse scenarios and investigating the impact of dynamic obstacles on behavior. This breakthrough underscores the dynamic nature of our research journey and our commitment to innovative ideas in our field.

### [Translating Virtual Prey-Predator Interaction to Real-World Robotic Environments: Enabling Multimodal Sensing and Evolutionary Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.3390/biomimetics8080580)
We have designed and implemented a prey-predator interaction scenario that incorporates visual and olfactory sensory cues not only in computer simulations but also in a real multi-robot system. Observed emergent spatial-temporal dynamics demonstrate successful transitioning of investigating prey-predator interactions from virtual simulations to the tangible world. It highlights the potential of multi-robotics approaches for studying prey-predator interactions and lays the groundwork for future investigations involving multi-modal sensory processing while considering real-world constraints.
