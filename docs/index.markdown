### A decentralised neural model explaining optimal integration of navigational strategies in insects
A bio-constrained computational model that a) applys frequency encoded image for insects visual navigation including visual homing and route following; b) uses ring attractor for optimal integration of navigational cues; c) argues the role played by the CX and MB in insect navigation.

### Robustness of Bio-Inspired Visual Systems for Collision Prediction in Critical Robot Traffic
By using the ColCOSP pheromone communication system to emulate city traffic as the scene for investgating LGMD model, thus exhibiting a novel, tractable, and affordable robotic approach to evaluate online visual systems in dynamic scene.

### An analysis of a ring attractor model for cue integration
We found that the classical ring-attractor network can do optimal integration of multiple direction cues without any neural plasticity, which is the basis of my future model of insect navigation.

### ColCOS Ï†: A multiple pheromone communication system for swarm robotics and social insects research
An optically emulated pheromone communication platform inspired by the multiple pheromone evidence found in ants. This platform could also localise the multiple robots based on vision.

### A Versatile Vision-Pheromone-Communication Platform for Swarm Robotics
Adding a dynamic changable wall to the arena is a very cool idea, and now we realised it! That's one cool thing that you can really feel in the journey of research!

### A Multiple Pheromone Communication System for Swarm Intelligence
We extended our ICARM2019 paper by adding systematic analysis and invetigation of our platform and arrange the results into this journal paper.

### How the insect central complex could coordinate multimodal navigation
We found the model proposed in my first eLife paper could also be used for explaining olfactory navigation of insects, which again demonstrating the CX could be the navigation center of insects and there are general mechanisms conserved across sensory domains and even different insect species.
